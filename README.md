Multi Signature Wallet Smart Contract [Multisigwallet]

How Does A Multisig Wallet Works?

Multisig requires either a set number of signatures/approvals before a transaction is sent, or a majority share of owners need to approve the transaction that is to be sent.

Multi sig wallets ensures no one person is able to unilaterally withdraw funds from an account. The more signatures required to execute a transaction, the more distributed the decision-making process can be.
